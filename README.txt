DO NOT place anything in the Parser folder, or alter it at all.
If you place .ml files in there, they may be deleted by the scripts.


Windows users:

Build the interpreter by running the file build.bat.

If you ever want to delete all the compiled files in order to
build from scratch, you can run clean.bat.


Mac/Linux users:

Build the interpreter by using the command:

    sh build.sh

If you want to delete compiled files and build from scratch, run:

    sh clean.sh

We have also included a makefile. You are free to use that instead
if you know how to.
